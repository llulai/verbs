# Verb Conjugator
This program is to help you to learn conjugations in romance languages (currently only Portuguese
is available). It uses a modified version of the
[Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) to decide which word to ask next.

# Why
I like to learn languages; currently I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; and while practicing my 
Portuguese (my native language is Spanish) I feel that most available apps
([memrise](https://memrise.com), [duolingo](https://duolingo.com),
[drops](https://languagedrops.com/)) are not really good at identifying my current level, often
making me over-practice words that I feel that I already mastered. Also these apps are focused 
into learning words more than how to conjugate verbs.

# How to use it
Clone the repo, navigate to the `app` folder and run 

```buildoutcfg
python main.app
```

# To do
